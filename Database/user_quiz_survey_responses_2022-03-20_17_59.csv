Because of his loving nature, our entire terrace has been turned as a garden. I always wished to make my own garden, but because of land lacking, I wasn’t able to do that.

But my hero has done that on the terrace. Our terrace looks really naturally beautiful. I love spending time there. Lots of my friends have visited this garden. There are more than 30 plants and most of them are flowers. My father is a businessman.

After working hard for years, he has been able to build his own business. He is a person, who believes in people and loves team working. Team working is not easy; you have to become a great leader to control the team. He is a motivator and inspiring character.

(minimum 50 words),,"There are various benefits of having an internationally recognized qualification such as there will be unlimited job opportunities and career options, increases chances of earning a handsome salary, allows us to expand our networks and knowledge, etc.",What was your favourite subject in school and why? (minimum 100 words),,"My favorite subject in school is Mathematics. It is my favorite because I never have difficulty with it and always get good marks in tests.

I suppose I am lucky to be born with a clear-thinking brain. So ever since young, manipulating numbers and figures came easy to me.

The wonderful thing about Mathematics is that, besides some formulae, there is nothing else to remember. Every step in solving a problem is done logically. Other subjects like History and Geography require a lot of memory work. Remembering dates and other facts is hard work compared with the ease and simplicity of mathematical reasoning.

While Mathematics is simple to me, some of my friends have great difficulty with it. I do not really understand why. They get stuck with simple problems and often give up. So I help them out when I can.

The one advantage I have in being good in Mathematics is that I do not have to spend a lot of time on it. Homework and tests are a breeze. So I have plenty of time left over to study other subjects. Sometimes I feel sorry for my less fortunate classmates who get scolded in class for not completing their Mathematics homework.
